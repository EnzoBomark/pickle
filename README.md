# Result and Option Utilities for TypeScript

The `Result` and `Option` utilities are designed to improve error handling and value management in TypeScript by providing a more functional approach. These utilities help you avoid common pitfalls associated with exceptions and null/undefined values.

## Purpose

Inspired by Rust's error-handling and takes cues from existing TypeScript libraries like [Oxide.ts](https://github.com/traverse1984/oxide.ts).

While this implementation isn't a direct 1:1 port from Rust or any other language (since JavaScript and TypeScript are not inherently designed with Result and Option types), the goal is to bring some of their key features into TypeScript. This library is built to work with TypeScript's type system, not against it, enhancing the developer experience in handling uncertain values and errors.
